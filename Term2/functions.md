Functions
=========

Has a math or statistics teacher ever asked you to perform a calculation and your response was:

<br>You and me both! It can be really hard to remember all of the formulas you need to use in a math or statistics class. Wouldn't it be nice if we could literally scream "do blah now!" to make the calculation magically happen? Well, you're in luck! In this class, we can essentially write the name of the calculation that we need to perform and our computer will happily take care of the rest.

<br>What do we call this magic? In data science, we call these commands <b><i>functions</i></b>. Functions are blocks of code that can be used over and over again to perform a specific action. Think of functions as the recipes of computer science! In the recipe, there are steps that need to be followed, and each step is specific about what needs to happen. Consider the following recipe for "the best chocolate chip cookies ever":

```

<br>Notice that this recipe, like most recipes, lists the ingredients that are needed at the top, and the steps that need to be performed at the bottom. And if you actually want to make the "best cookies ever", you can't just haphazardly perform the steps that you feel like completing, with whatever ingredients that you feel like using that day; you have to follow the recipe EXACTLY as it is written.

Computers treat functions the same way! They want to make the "best cookies ever", so they carefully grab the ingredients listed at the top and execute each step in the recipe EXACTLY as it is written, from top to bottom (wouldn't make sense to follow a recipe from bottom to top now, would it?)

Obviously, our computers won't be used to bake cookies this term (boo!). Instead, we will ask our computer to use recipes (*cough* functions *cough*) to perform statistical calculations. For example, if your stats teacher asked you to calculate the standard deviation of a data set, we could use a standard deviation function to get our computer to calculate the standard deviation for us. Easy, right?

In many cases, you don't even have to remember the formula and write it down for your computer to use; some other programmer in the world has already done that for you! It's like searching for a new cookie recipe online; you don't have to go through the effort of coming up with the recipe yourself. And because data science is so popular, all of the formulas that you use in statistics have already been added to the toolbox of functions you can use in your programs.

So, how do we actually ask our computers to execute a function?
