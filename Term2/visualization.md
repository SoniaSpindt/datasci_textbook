Visualizing Data
================

Tables are really great for organizing large amounts of data. However, it can be hard to look at a table and see what important trends and patterns exist within its data; sometimes, it's much easier to look at a graph to see what's going on.

This is where data scientists become amazing storytellers! They use data visualizations to make convincing arguments about the world around them. Don't believe me? Watch this video to see how a beautiful graph and a good story can make any data scientist the most interesting person in the room:

We will spend the rest of the term learning how to visualize large data sets like David McCandless, and this is where your story-telling skills will come in handy! Although this text will specifically focus on describing the programming concepts that you need to make your own visualizations with Python, our Make Assignments will be used to put our storytelling skills to work. By the end of this class, you will be able to tell your own stories about the data sets that you find interesting and worthwhile.
