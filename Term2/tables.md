OMG. If Ronaldo said it, it must be true and totally worth our while to learn about.

So what are these <b><i>tables</i></b> he's talking about? Well, tables are a series of columns and rows used to represent a data set.

Confused? It's the same idea that you learned about in your science classes, where your teacher asked you to draw a <i>table</i> in your notebook when you were preparing to collect data during an experiment. You used columns to collect specific pieces of information about a series of observations, like temperature or color, and you used rows to collect all of the information about a single observation. It's the same thing in data science, except now we can create tables with code!

Still confused? Here's an example of a table that contains information about ice cream:

See! It's a series of named columns and rows that contains information about ice cream (*cough* it's a data set about ice cream *cough*). The table above has seven rows. Most of the rows correspond to one ice cream flavor and all of the information that is related to that particular ice cream flavor.

The table also has three columns: flavor, color, and price. Every value that is found in a column is the same type of information. For example, all of the information found in the last column of our ice cream table is related to price. The label of each column is found in the first row of the table; the first row of your table will always contain column labels! We will refer to specific columns by their labels.

Ice cream is cool and all, but not every table that you make will be about ice cream. How can you create a new table that contains information about, well, anything?
